As you floss, these soft strands expand to whoosh away sticky plaque and cavity-causing bacteria.

Smart Floss is made of multifilament polyester fibers using a proprietary, patented process that allows the floss to expand.

PBAT is a fully biodegradable polymer that breaks down completely when buried in real soil environments and without creating or emitting methane or any harmful toxins. The three materials this floss is made of have a great fusion, making it extremely strong, smooth, and consistent.",

  {
    brand: "Etee Floss",
    description: "This floss is BIG on keeping our chompers and the houses that they live in (i.e., their gums) healthy, so having a plastic-free floss option was a no-brainer for us. Each spool contains 30 meters of our 100% pure mulberry silk, candelilla wax, and natural peppermint oil floss. Mulberry silk, also known as Ahimsa Silk (or Peace Silk), is made from the cocoon of the mulberry silkworm. The harvesting process is cruelty-free as the silkworm is able to turn into a moth and fly away before the cocoon is finally harvested! So, let's get flossing (and we ain't talking about that fancy dance all the kids are doing these days)! Completely biodegradable & plastic-free floss to keep your entire family's teeth healthy!",
