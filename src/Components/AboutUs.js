            The researchers found that several types of dental floss contained fluorine, which indicates the presence of PFAS compounds. PFHxS is part of a large class of chemicals called PFASs, which are found in many consumer products ranging from nonstick cookware to waterproof clothing to food packaging, and are also used in firefighting foams at airports and military bases. These chemicals have been linked to liver damage, harm to the immune system, developmental issues, and cancer, and can persist in peopleâ€™s bodies and in the environment for many years. Some types of floss are made with toxic chemicals like Teflon.
